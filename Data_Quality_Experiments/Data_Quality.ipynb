    "# Data Quality Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us peak inside a dataset and see what we find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be looking for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Completeness:\n",
    "Completeness refers to how much information is available for all entities within your dataset. It assesses whether there are any missing values in your data. A higher level of completeness indicates that there are fewer missing values, ensuring that your dataset contains a comprehensive representation of the entities it describes. To evaluate completeness, you can count the number of missing values for each attribute or entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consistency:\n",
    "Consistency measures how uniform and consistent your data is throughout the dataset. It involves identifying and quantifying the number of inconsistencies or discrepancies within your data. These inconsistencies could include variations in data formats, naming conventions, or conflicting information. Maintaining data consistency is crucial for reliable analysis and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy:\n",
    "Accuracy assesses how correct and error-free your data is. It involves identifying and counting the number of errors within your dataset. Errors could be typographical, computational, or factual inaccuracies. Accurate data is essential for making informed decisions and avoiding misleading conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relevancy/Auditability:\n",
    "Relevancy or auditability focuses on the presence of relevant data within your dataset. It involves evaluating the number of irrelevant values or records that do not contribute to the goals of your analysis or business needs. Ensuring that your dataset contains only pertinent information enhances its usability and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Validity:\n",
    "Validity checks whether the data in your dataset adheres to predefined rules or allowable values. It involves validating data against established constraints or criteria to ensure that it meets quality standards. Valid data is trustworthy and conforms to expected norms, reducing the risk of using incorrect or invalid information.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness:\n",
    "Uniqueness measures how many duplicate values or records exist within your dataset. It is essential to identify and eliminate duplicates, as they can skew analysis results and waste storage resources. Maintaining data uniqueness ensures that each entity or data point is represented only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Timeliness:\n",
    "Timeliness assesses how up-to-date your data is. It involves determining whether the data has been regularly updated to reflect the current state of the entities it describes. Timely data is critical for making decisions based on current information, especially in dynamic environments where data can quickly become outdated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating these data quality dimensions is essential for ensuring that your dataset is reliable, accurate, and suitable for your intended purposes. It helps in making informed decisions, conducting meaningful analyses, and maintaining data integrity over time."

    "Now, we venture into the realm of subject matter expertise (SME), requiring a profound comprehension of the data before embarking on rigorous data quality assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, the focus shifts towards discerning the relevance and auditability of the data. It entails a comprehensive exploration of the dataset's intricacies and nuances to ascertain its alignment with the specific objectives and context in which it will be utilized. Here, subject matter experts play a pivotal role, bringing their deep domain knowledge to the fore.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine relevance, one must carefully evaluate whether the data at hand addresses the key questions or issues that prompted its collection. This involves not only considering the variables and attributes but also understanding how they interrelate and influence the overarching goals of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, auditability comes into play, emphasizing the necessity of establishing a robust trail of data lineage, transformations, and processing steps. An auditable dataset ensures that every data point can be traced back to its source and that any transformations or manipulations are well-documented and transparent. This is essential for maintaining data integrity, regulatory compliance, and for building trust in the data's credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this phase, experts delve into the intricacies of the data, gaining insights into potential biases, anomalies, or limitations that may impact its usability. They may also identify data gaps that need to be addressed for a more comprehensive analysis. Consequently, subject matter expertise is invaluable in guiding the subsequent data quality tests and in tailoring them to the unique characteristics and demands of the dataset, ensuring that the data is not only accurate but also relevant and auditable for the intended purpose."

    "\n",
    "Data validity, in essence, is the determination of how well the data aligns with the predefined criteria or standards. To carry out this assessment effectively, one must possess a keen insight into the intricacies of the data, backed by a comprehensive comprehension of the anticipated values within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process extends beyond merely confirming the data's existence; it delves into evaluating whether the data accurately represents the real-world entities or phenomena it is intended to capture. This often involves examining the data against a set of established rules, constraints, or expectations. It is at this juncture that subject matter expertise and contextual knowledge are paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep understanding of expected values allows data professionals to discern whether the data points fall within the permissible ranges or adhere to the anticipated patterns. Any deviations from these expectations may raise questions about the data's validity. Such anomalies could stem from errors in data collection, transmission, or processing, and may require further investigation or corrective actions to rectify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, understanding the expected values aids in the identification of outliers or anomalies that might not be immediately evident but can have significant implications for data analysis and decision-making. These outliers, if left unaddressed, could skew results and lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n",
